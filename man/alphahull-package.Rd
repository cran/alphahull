\title{
Generalization of the Convex Hull of a Sample of Points in the Plane
}
\description{
Computation of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape and \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull of a given sample of points in the plane. The concepts of \eqn{\alpha}-shape and \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull generalize the definition of the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is based on the duality between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation. The package also includes a function that returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its dual Voronoi diagram in one single object.}
