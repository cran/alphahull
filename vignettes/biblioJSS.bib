  abstract = {{Given a finite set of distinct, isolated points in a continuous space
	(often the Euclidean plane), we associate all locations in that space
	with the closest member of the point set. The result is a partitioning
	of the space into a set of regions. This construction is called a
	Voronoi diagram, the regions are called Voronoi regions and there
	exists a lot of different areas where this concept can be applied.
	This book is a comprehensive exposition of Voronoi diagrams consisting
	of nine chapters. It is intended for graduate students as an introduction
	and for researchers who need a thorough reference work. The authors
	have been able to structure and unify the enormous amount of contributions
	coming from different disciplines.\par The book starts with an history
	of the concept of Voronoi diagram and gives some mathematical preliminaries.
	In Chapter 2 definitions and basic properties of Voronoi diagrams
	are given. This includes also the related concept of Delaunay triangulation.
	The Delaunay triangulation can be seen as a dual of the Voronoi diagram.
	We get it by joining those of the given points of the Voronoi diagram
	for which the corresponding Voronoi regions are neighbors. Chapter
	3 deals with generalizations of the Voronoi diagram. Weights on the
	given set of points can be taken into consideration. Also Voronoi
	diagram for several points at a time are discussed. They are called
	higher-order Voronoi diagrams. Further generalizations include farthest-point
	Voronoi diagrams, the $k$th nearest-point Voronoi diagram, and Voronoi
	diagrams with obstacles. For the case where the given set consists
	of lines or areas some results are presented. Another important extension
	is to look at distances different from the Euclidean distance. Finally
	network Voronoi diagrams and Voronoi diagrams for moving points are
	looked at.\par The important topic of algorithms for computing Voronoi
	diagrams is the contents of Chapter $4$. For the classical planar
	case three different approaches are described: the incremental method,
	the divide-and-conquer method and the plane sweep method. Then practical
	techniques for implementing the algorithms (avoiding numerical errors)
	are discussed. After that, algorithms for higher-dimensional Voronoi
	diagrams and for generalized Voronoi diagrams are described. The
	chapter ends with approximation algorithms. In Chapter 5 Poisson
	Voronoi diagrams are introduced. The Poisson Voronoi Diagram (PVD)
	refers to the situation in which points are located in space ``at
	random" according to the homogeneous Poisson point process. Properties
	and structural results for the PVD are presented. Then stochastic
	processes induced by Poisson Voronoi diagrams are discussed. The
	rest of this chapter deals with extensions analogous to the ones
	described in Chapter 3. The remaining four chapters concentrate on
	some important areas of application for Voronoi diagrams. In Chapter
	6 it is investigated how Voronoi diagrams can been used to facilitate
	the presentation and analysis of spatial data (values of one or more
	variables observed at a set of data sites in space). This includes
	topics like finding neighbor relationships, approximating surfaces
	and ordering multivariate data.\par Chapter 7 discusses models of
	spatial processes. At least four types of spatial processes, assignment
	(Section 7.1), growth (Section 7.2), some spatial temporal processes
	(Section 7.3) and spatial competition (Section 7.4) can be represented
	in this way. The application of such models is extensive and examples
	from areas as diverse as crystallography, solid state physics, biology,
	astronomy, physiology, archaeology and urban economics are presented.
	The use of the Voronoi diagram and the Delaunay tessellation in point
	pattern analysis is described in Chapter 8. First polygon-based and
	triangle-based methods are presented. Then nearest neighbor distance
	models are discussed. The question how to facilitate locational optimization
	through Voronoi diagrams is addressed in the last chapter. When several
	new facilities have to be located in many models it is required to
	assign clients to new facilities. This can be done in a very natural
	way by using Voronoi diagrams. Different aspects of that observation
	are discussed in this chapter. Topics include locational optimization
	of points, locational optimization of lines and locational optimization
	over time. In the second edition some new research directions have
	been taken into account. Also the already excellent bibliography
	of the first edition has been greatly expanded to 1680 references.}},

  abstract = {{Ausgehend von den Arbeiten von {\it Hermite} und {\it Lejeune- Dirichlet},
	stellt sich der Verf. das Problem, die reduzierten Formen der Klassen
	positiver quadratischer Formen von $n$ Variablen zu geben, und gelingt
	dabei zu ähnlichen Resultaten wie {\it Minkowski}. Er definiert hierzu
	die {\it Paralleloëder}: Alle Punkte, für die $$a_{0k}+\sum_{i---1}^n
	a_{ik}\ x_i\geqq 0\qquad (k---1,2,\dots , \sigma )$$ ist, bilden
	ein konvexes Polyeder $R$. Dasselbe heißt Paralleloëder, wenn man
	mit demselben durch Substitutionen $$x_i---x_i'-\lambda_i\quad (i---1,2,\dots
	,n) $$ den $n$ dimensionalen Raum gleichmäßig überdecken kann. Seine
	Ecken sind {\it einfach}, wenn sie nur $(n+1)$ verschiedenen Paralleloëdern
	angehören. Ein Paralleloëder mit nur einfachen Ecken heißt {\it primitiv},
	sonst imprimitiv. Über die primitiven Paralleloëder beweist der Verf.
	das Theorem: Transformiert man dasselbe durch alle reellen linearen
	Substitutionen $$x_i---\alpha_{i0}+\sum_{k---1}^n \alpha_{ik}x_k'\quad
	(i---1,2,\dots ,n),$$ so erhält eine Menge von primitiven Paralleloëdern,
	welche durch eine {\it Klasse} positiver quadratischer Formen eindeutig
	bestimmt ist, falls man Formen mit proportionalen Koeffizienten als
	gleich ansieht. (Data of JFM: JFM 39.0274.01; Copyright 2005 Jahrbuch
